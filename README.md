# Personal Web Portfolio

## An online portfolio built from the ground up

This is a web app built to showcase myself as a developer. The site contains details about me, my projects, and how to contact me.

- This site was built to showcase my skillset to potential employers. The web app itself becomes a showcase of talent/vision.

- This site enables interested parties to easily find development projects that I have created or worked on, as well as learn more about me and how to get in touch. This, in theory, will make me a better job candidate during a career search.

- By creating this portfolio, I became more comfortable and confident creating layouts and styling elements. This will be a fun project to update as my skill level grows and I have more impressive work to showcase.
