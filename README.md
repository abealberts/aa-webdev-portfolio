# Personal Web Portfolio

## An online portfolio built from the ground up

This is a web app built to showcase myself as a developer. The site contains details about me, my projects, and how to contact me.

- This site was built to showcase my skillset to potential employers. The web app itself becomes a showcase of talent/vision.

- This site enables interested parties to easily find development projects that I have created or worked on, as well as learn more about me and how to get in touch. This, in theory, will make me a better job candidate during a career search.

- By creating this portfolio, I became more comfortable and confident creating layouts and styling elements. This will be a fun project to update as my skill level grows and I have more impressive work to showcase.

## Usage

### [Visit my online development portfolio by clicking here.](https://abealberts.github.io/aa-webdev-portfolio/)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
